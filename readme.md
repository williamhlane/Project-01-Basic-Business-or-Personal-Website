This was made by William Harrison Lane III, this project is a portfolio web site designed to show a few images of me, write a description of my skill sets and show youtube videos of what I can do. It has a video carousel at the top of the page, a home page containing images with text, it has a video page that uses a grid to show the videos, it also has a contact page with a contact form. In the www directory you can open index.html, the contactus.html or videos.html in any browser. After that you can see view the videos in the carousel or on the videos page or use the contact us page to submit your email and a message. On large screen sizes you can see the navigation bar to the left and smaller screen sizes have the nav bar above the main content of the page. This projects use HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. In the future this can be improved with a javascrip image viewerand a images page.
